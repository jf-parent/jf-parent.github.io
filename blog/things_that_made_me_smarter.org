* Introduction
** I compiled this list of things that I feel made me smarter and sharper over the past couple years. This list is obviously highly subjective...
* Things that made me smarter
** Switching to Emacs ([[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]])
 * I was using Vim/tmux before I switched to Spacemacs (my conversion was fuelled by the fact that I could still use the ergonomic keybinding of Vim while taking advantage of all the extra features offered by the Emacs ecosystem. I also discovered emacs lisp and prefer it over Vimscript).
 * I was using Wunderlist before switching to org-mode (when it got acquired by Microsoft I decided to look for alternative and org-mode seem like a future proof choice).
 * I was using wikidot for my personal wiki and I switched to [[https://github.com/caiorss/org-wiki][org-wiki]] naturally.
** Learning some Lisp
 * Out of curiosity and to increase my understanding of Emacs I started to learn some Lisp. Initially Emacs Lisp then Common Lisp to finally discover Clojure.
 * I enjoy watching [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV8p6Lb-bd6UZtTc_QD4zA][Baggers]] videos.
 * I am using Clojure to play with [[https://github.com/overtone/overtone][Overtone]] and [[http://quil.info/][Quil]].

** Mind Map
 * I started to do some of my planning and brainstorming with [[https://mindnode.com/][Mind Map]]. Having my ideas represented visually allow me to think more effectively.
** Reading
 * Everyday I read a few articles from Hacker News.
 * I read a lot of articles from Wikipedia by chunking them by section (I can spend a few days on one article if it has a lot of sections so this reading methodology has some spaced repetition caracteristics).
 * I organize my online reading through topical folders where I have 2 folders per topic (FOCUS and FUTURE). I dump every new items in the FUTURE folder and choose from it when I am finished with an article in the FOCUS folder. I try to limit the number of items in the FOCUS folder to less than 5. I have currently around 5-6 topical folders...
** Feed
 * I configured a newsletter subscriptions feed in my mailbox using a dedicated email address that get redirected to my main email address and filtered into a specific folder.
** Memorization

** Journaling
 * I write a daily journal of the important stuffs that happen the day before. I then review these entries and organize them into my weekly journal. 
 * I maintain a few other journals also (Gratitude Journal, Emotional Diary, Open Questions, Open Problems, Decision Journal, Forecast Journal and Error Log).
** Writing
 * Distilling and organizing my thoughts decluster my mind and therefore make me more effective.
** Thinking
 * I try to do a deep thinking session every month where I either focus on solving a hard problem in my life or use something like the Cartesian doubt to get out of local minima...
** Languages
 * I work on improving my Mandarin, French and English vocabulary daily (using mnemosyne flash cards).

* Things that made me sharper
** Dual N-Back
 * I use [[https://www.iqmindware.com/][IQ Mindware]] (I do Dual N-Back on and off; it's hard not to feel like you are not wasting your time while n-backing but it is fun from time to time).
** Training
 * I train daily ([[https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-prisoner-workout/][Prisoner workout]] if I am limited in time or space). My traning include a 20-30 minutes session of either martial art, [[https://www.maxwellsc.com/bjj-mobility.cfm][BJJ Mobility]], [[https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Maxwell-Encyclopedia-Joint-Mobility/dp/B0014JBJYW][Joint Mobility]], Wim Hof exercise routine, bodyweight training or [[https://extremekettlebells.com/][Kettlebells]] and I finish off with 10-20 minutes of stationary cycling.
