I learned about Bongard problem reading a blog post of David Chapman titled: [[https://metarationality.com/bongard-meta-rationality][A first lesson in meta-rationality | Meta-rationality]]

It inspired me to create an IQ test based on the Bongard problem.

Bongard problem was created by Russian computer scientist Mikhail Moiseevich Bongard ([[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bongard_problem][Bongard problem - Wikiwand]]).

Bongard problems can be culture fair or not and offer a vast creative level of freedom.

There is an [[https://www.foundalis.com/res/bps/bpidx.htm][index]] of Bongard problems maintain by Harry Foundalis (he wrote a [[https://www.foundalis.com/res/diss_research.html][dissertation]] on the topic).

Currently there is 2 free of charge tests available on BongardIQ (I have plan to create a paid version later that will be timed also). One has 10 questions and the other one 40 questions.

The test result is not yet normalize so it return only a score. As soon as possible, it will return a proper IQ.

One of the main difference between solving a normal Bongard problem and a BongardIQ problem is that there is no language communication in the BongardIQ, only selection. That make some of them easier (you don't have to exactly describe the rule) and some of them harder (the choices offers can mislead you).

One of the hurdle I faced during the creation of BongardIQ was the late realisation that the right side's rule can simply be the logical negation of the left side's rule (or vice-versa). For example, if the left side's rule is "circle" then the right side's rule can be "not circle" even though you only see squares on the right side so the rule is actually "square" (or vice-versa "not square" which is very different from a rule like "circle"). Some Bongard problems listed in the [[https://www.foundalis.com/res/bps/bpidx.htm][index]] have a right side's rule that is not the logical negation of the left side's rule but something specific. These type of problems in the context of BongardIQ need some adaption to be valid.
