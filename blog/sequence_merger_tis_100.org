Here is my solution for Sequence Merger in TIS-100 (610/6/44):

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="/media/images/sequence_merger.png" />
#+END_EXPORT

This one got me puzzle for longer than expected (I failed at using the stack on my first try so my current solution doesn't use it). I deal with 0 by transforming them in 999 (otherwise it will send the 0 before any other values). I check in the node that signal to OUT.S if the value is 999, if so I transform it back to 0. I loop in the nodes containing the left and the right value if their value was bigger than the other so that they resend it for another check; if the value is smaller I send it down...
