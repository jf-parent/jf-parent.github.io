Here is my solution for Exposure Mask Viewer in TIS-100 (1115/4/41):

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="/media/images/exposure_mask_viewer.png" />
#+END_EXPORT

This is a bit tricky since there is a need for 2 loops. I store the X in the second node, the Y and the Height in the third node and finally the Width in the fourth node. We need to send the same X for as long as the Height is greater than 0. We need to send the color code for white (3) as long as the Width is greater than 0. I add the height to the Y and decrement by 1 for every turn...
