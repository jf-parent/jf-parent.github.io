* Silhouette Score
** Definition
*** The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).
*** The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.
** Formula
*** Let /a(i)/ be the average distance of /i/ with all other data within the same cluster. We can interpret /a(i)/ as how well /i/  is assigned to its cluster (the smaller the value, the better the assignment).

*** Let /b(i)/ be the lowest average distance of /i/ to all points in any other cluster, of which /i/ is not a member. The cluster with this lowest average dissimilarity is said to be the "neighbouring cluster" of /i/ because it is the next best fit cluster for point /i/.

\begin{equation}
s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max\{a(i),b(i)\}}
\end{equation}
